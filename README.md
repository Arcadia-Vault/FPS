### Characters (Original Halo 4 and Halo 3)
<h4 align="center">Mark VI [GEN2]</h5>
The MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor/Mark VI was the third major version of the MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor. The last mainline MJOLNIR GEN1 suit to be widely issued,<sup>[3]</sup> the Mark VI was issued to the few surviving Spartan-II supersoldiers in October 2552, replacing the Mark V. Shortly after the end of the Human-Covenant War, it was replaced by the Mark VII<sup>[4]</sup> and MJOLNIR [GEN2]. The Mark VI could still be requisitioned by Spartan-IV personnel as late as October 2558, albeit upgraded to function with the GEN2 suite.<sup>[3][5]</sup> In early 2559, in the midst of the Created conflict, the Mark VI armor has been upgraded to the GEN3 platform.<sup>[6][7]</sup>

<h4 align="center">FOTUS</h5>
FOTUS-class Mjolnir is a variant of the MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor [GEN2] manufactured by 343 Industries.<sub>[2]</sub> The helmet has a Torque-node component used to distract nearby predators, the base of the node detects levels of gravity-trough scaturiency. The helmet also features extended awareness conduits (ALK-03) which heightens mobility around senior operatives and moving-equipment personnel. The visor has lodged-tracking component 793-VF for improved survivability and maintenance. The chest has 90-RZ java-fuel monitoring software which evaluates current sustainability levels.<sub>[1][Note 1]</sub>
