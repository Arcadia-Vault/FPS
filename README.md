Shortly after the end of the Human-Covenant War, it was replaced by the Mark VII<sup>[4]</sup> and MJOLNIR [GEN2]. The Mark VI could still be requisitioned by Spartan-IV personnel as late as October 2558, albeit upgraded to function with the GEN2 suite.<sup>[3][5]</sup> In early 2559, in the midst of the Created conflict, the Mark VI armor has been upgraded to the GEN3 platform.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
